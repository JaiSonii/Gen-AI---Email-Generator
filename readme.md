üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)

    Python 3.9+ and pip

    Google Chrome (for Selenium)

1. Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>

2. Backend Setup

First, navigate to the backend directory (assuming it's named backend).
Bash

cd backend

    Create a Virtual Environment:
    Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory by copying the example:
Bash

cp .env.example .env

Now, edit the .env file and add your API keys:

SERPAPI_API_KEY="Your key"
BRIGHT_DATA_API_KEY="Your key"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="Your Google Gemini API Key"

Run the Backend Server:
Bash

    uvicorn app.main:create_app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 --reload

    The backend API will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

3. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory (assuming it's named frontend).
Bash

cd frontend

    Install Dependencies:
    Bash

npm install

Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env.local file in the frontend root directory. Add the following line to point to your running backend API:

VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/api

Run the Frontend Development Server:
Bash

npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080 (or another port if 8080 is busy).
